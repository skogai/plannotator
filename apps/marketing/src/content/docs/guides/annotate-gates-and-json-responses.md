`plannotator annotate` and `plannotator annotate-last` accept three flags that turn markdown annotation into a full review gate with structured output.

## Capabilities

- **`--gate`** adds an Approve button to the annotation UI. The reviewer picks one of three decisions: approve, send annotations, or close.
- **`--json`** emits every decision as a structured JSON object on stdout so hooks and plugins can route on the outcome without parsing free text.
- **`--silent-approve`** suppresses the plaintext approve marker so Approve emits empty stdout. Naive hooks that treat any stdout as a block signal opt in here to keep silence-is-permission intact.
- The flags compose. Use any alone or together.
- Identical semantics across every supported harness: Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Pi, and Codex.

 --gate --json            │  3-button        │  {"decision":"approved"}│  {"decision":"dismissed"}│  {"decision":"annotated","feedback":"..."}
```

### JSON schema

```json
{
  "decision": "approved" | "annotated" | "dismissed",
  "feedback": "string (present only when decision is 'annotated')"
}
```

### Example outputs

**Approved** (reviewer clicked Approve, `--gate --json`):

```json
{"decision":"approved"}
```

**Dismissed** (reviewer clicked Close, `--json` or `--gate --json`):

```json
{"decision":"dismissed"}
```

**Annotated** (reviewer sent annotations, `--json` or `--gate --json`). The `feedback` field is the same markdown Plannotator emits in plaintext mode:

```json
{
  "decision": "annotated",
  "feedback": "# File Feedback\n\nI've reviewed this file and have 2 pieces of feedback:\n\n## 1. Remove this\n`the selected text`\n> I don't want this.\n\n## 2. Feedback on: \"some highlighted text\"\n> This needs more detail.\n\n---"
}
```

The object is emitted as a single line of JSON per invocation. One invocation, one decision, one line on stdout.

## `--gate`

A three-way review decision. The annotation UI adds an Approve button alongside Close and Send Annotations. The reviewer declares intent explicitly:

- **Approve.** The artifact is good as written. The agent should proceed.
- **Send Annotations.** The reviewer has specific changes. The feedback is returned verbatim.
- **Close.** The session ends without a decision. Neither a signal to the agent nor an instruction set.

In plaintext mode, Approve emits the single line `The user approved.` on stdout so templates and agents can distinguish approval from close without needing `--json`. Close emits nothing. Send Annotations emits the feedback markdown. Hook authors who treat any non-empty stdout as a block signal can add `--silent-approve` to suppress the marker, or use `--json` for structured routing.

## `--json`

Structured stdout. Every decision is emitted as a JSON object with a `decision` field and optionally a `feedback` payload. Hooks and plugins that need explicit routing (log approvals separately from dismissals, gate on decision type, accumulate telemetry) use this.

`--json` is orthogonal to `--gate`:

- `--json` alone keeps the two-button UI. Only `annotated` and `dismissed` decisions are emitted.
- `--gate --json` unlocks all three decisions in structured form.
- On OpenCode and Pi, `--json` is accepted silently. Those harnesses write back to the session directly rather than via stdout, so the flag has no effect there. Recipes remain portable.

## `--silent-approve`

Suppresses the plaintext approve marker. With `--gate --silent-approve`, Approve emits empty stdout (instead of `The user approved.`), matching Close. Send Annotations still emits feedback.

This is the shape naive hooks want — the ones that treat any non-empty stdout as a block signal:

- Approve → empty → hook passes → agent proceeds.
- Close → empty → hook passes → agent proceeds.
- Send Annotations → feedback → hook blocks with that feedback as the reason.

`--silent-approve` only affects plaintext mode. In `--json` mode, Approve still emits `{"decision":"approved"}` — JSON callers route on the `decision` field, so there's no ambiguity to silence. The flag is accepted silently on OpenCode and Pi for the same reason `--json` is: those harnesses don't use stdout as the signal channel.

## Primary use cases

### Spec-driven development frameworks

Spec-driven development frameworks like spec-kit, kiro, and openspec generate multiple markdown artifacts per feature: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`. Each goes through clarify, review, and approve cycles. Plannotator's annotation UI is a first-class fit for reviewing these artifacts: inline, targeted feedback on markdown is exactly what these workflows need.

With `--gate`, a PostToolUse hook on Write triggers a full review gate every time the agent produces a spec artifact. The reviewer approves, annotates, or dismisses. The agent proceeds, revises, or skips accordingly.

### Turn-by-turn review

`plannotator annotate-last --gate` wired into a Claude Code Stop hook pauses every agent turn for human review. Approve closes the turn cleanly. Send Annotations re-prompts the agent with the reviewer's feedback. Close ends the turn without injecting anything.

### Programmatic decision routing

When a hook or plugin needs to distinguish approve from dismiss, `--json` provides a single-line, stable contract. One-shot decisions become machine-readable events. No stdout parsing, no fragility.

## Hook integration recipes

See [Hook Integration](/docs/guides/hook-integration/) for copy-paste recipes that wire these flags into PostToolUse and Stop hooks on Claude Code, plus portable variants for OpenCode and Pi.

## Exit codes

Every decision exits `0`. Signals live on stdout. This keeps Plannotator composable with harnesses that use exit codes for their own purposes.
