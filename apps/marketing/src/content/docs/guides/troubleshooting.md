## Lost a Plannotator tab?

If you accidentally close a Plannotator browser tab, the server is still running in the background. You can find and reopen it:

```bash
plannotator sessions
```

This lists all active sessions with their mode, project, URL, and how long they've been running:

```
Active Plannotator sessions:

  #1  review    my-project           http://localhost:54321    3m ago
  #2  plan      my-project           http://localhost:12345    15m ago

Reopen with: plannotator sessions --open [N]
```

To reopen one:

```bash
plannotator sessions --open       # reopens the most recent
plannotator sessions --open 2     # reopens session #2
```

Stale sessions from crashed processes are cleaned up automatically. You can also force cleanup with `plannotator sessions --clean`.

## Where does Plannotator store data?

All local data lives under `~/.plannotator/`:

| Directory | What's in it |
|-----------|-------------|
| `plans/` | Snapshots of approved and denied plans. Controlled by the "Save plans" toggle in Settings. |
| `history/` | Automatic version history for every plan, organized by project and heading. Powers the plan diff and version browser. |
| `drafts/` | Auto-saved annotation drafts. If a server crashes mid-review, your in-progress annotations are recovered on the next session. |
| `sessions/` | Temporary session files for active servers. Cleaned up automatically when a server exits. |

Plan saving is enabled by default. You can change the save directory or disable it entirely in the Plannotator UI settings (gear icon).

## Browser doesn't open

If the UI doesn't open automatically, check:

- **Remote/SSH session?** Set `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE=1` and `PLANNOTATOR_PORT` to a port you'll forward. See the [remote guide](/docs/guides/remote-and-devcontainers/).
- **Wrong browser?** Set `PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER` to the app name or path, or use `--browser` for a one-off override.
- **URL still works** — even if the browser didn't open, the server is running. Check `plannotator sessions` for the URL and open it manually.

## Hook doesn't fire

If `ExitPlanMode` doesn't trigger Plannotator:

1. Make sure the plugin is installed: `/plugin install plannotator@plannotator`
2. Restart Claude Code after installing (hooks load on startup)
3. Verify `plannotator` is on your PATH: `which plannotator`
4. Check that plan mode is enabled in your Claude Code session

## OpenCode build agent cannot call `submit_plan`

This is expected with the default OpenCode workflow. Plannotator now defaults to `plan-agent`, which keeps `submit_plan` available to OpenCode's `plan` agent and hides or denies it for `build` and other non-planning primary agents.

If you want the old broad behavior, opt in from `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "all-agents"
    }]
  ]
}
```

If you do not want automatic plan review at all, use `workflow: "manual"` and run `/plannotator-last` or `/plannotator-annotate` when you want Plannotator.
